# AWESOME MLP Tutoriol

This is a modified version for building an MLP network from the Book Neural Networks and Deep Learning written by Michael Nielsen. You could find many different and interest topics from his repository. Please google him, he is very smart. This repository mainly serves as a tutoriol for only MLP built from scratch. I will include my handwritten notes later.

## Install Dependencies
``` Shell
$ conda create --name MLPenv python=3.8
$ conda activate MLPenv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
