# AWESOME MLP Tutoriol

This is a modified version for building an MLP network from the Book Neural Networks and Deep Learning written by Michael Nielsen. Sevral modification includes fixing lower version python codes couldn't work in the environment of py3.0+. 

## Purpose
This repository mainly serves as a tutoriol for beginners focused on studying MLP built from scratch. I will include my handwritten notes later.

## Install Dependencies
``` Shell
$ conda create --name MLPenv python=3.8
$ conda activate MLPenv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Maintain Dependencies
All required packages should be listed clearly in the `requiremens.txt` documents.
To quickly update the newly installed packages, run the following command:
``` Shell
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
